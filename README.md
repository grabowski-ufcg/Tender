    <br>Match with recepies, not with people</br>
</h1>

### Do you love cooking but don't know what to do? Search no more, dear fella. 

Using Tender you can match with recipes, not people. 

To find those you can like or dislike by swiping meals based on its photos and a small description about it. 
Once you and your meal have “matched”, its recipe will be visible on your menu area.

### Screen ideas:
- SignUp and SignIn: basic authentication areas;
- RecipeFeed: a place to match with the best recipes on our database;
- Menu: containing all the previously matched recipes;
- Recipe details: an area where all the recipe information is presented to the user.



### Deploy

Our team is still fighting in the battle to deploy this awesome application. 
But we got some loot on the last clash :feelsgood:, like [this juicy link for our api](https://tender-apy.herokuapp.com/api/v1).

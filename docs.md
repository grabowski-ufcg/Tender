## Sources that were used during the making of this project:

### Dataset
- [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/): Great food API, but most recipes are too expensive to consider making;
- [EightPortions](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/): Huge (70,000) recipe dataset, but a bit unorganized for this project purpose.
- [Food Recipe dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snehallokesh31096/recipe): The chosen dataset for this project, due to organization, quantity and overall quality. 

### MongoDB

- [mLab](https://mlab.com/): Database-as-a-Service for MongoDB that offers a free plan (which is a great price :D )
- [Random record from MongoDB](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2824157/random-record-from-mongodb): Get collection random sample at MongoDB.

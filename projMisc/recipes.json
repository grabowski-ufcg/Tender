Place about 1-ounce of filling into the center of a wrapper using a tablespoon. Dip your finger in the water (or use a wet brush) and run your wet finger (or wet brush) along 2 connected edges of the wrapper. (Say, for example, the left side and the bottom.) The area you are creating here is a moist strip along the half of the perimeter where water is applied. Fold the wrapper over on the diagonal. The 2 moist sides will bond to their dry counterparts to make a nice little triangular pocket. Remember that the water acts like a glue. Thus, if wet edges are folded to the dry edges, all is well; otherwise, your pot stickers will come open. (If you get pulled away in the process of assembling, cover the wrappers with a kitchen towel to keep them moist until you get back.)", "To give the folded-over wrappers that traditional pot sticker look, pick up the wrapper and fold over the sides that have been joined with water in a pleating action. Make 3 or 4 pleats. Put the assembled wrappers on a parchment-lined pan, but make sure that they do not touch each other. If they are left touching, they will stick together, which is bad news because, when you go to separate them, you will have pot stickers with holes. However, this is less of a problem if you use traditional pot sticker wrappers, as they are thicker. When all of the pot stickers are assembled in wrappers, you can cook them immediately at this point or you can freeze them for future cooking. We freeze them by the hundreds at the Diner, placing them in airtight containers more suited for freezer storage.", "For the potstickers: Heat a griddle, wok, or pan over medium-high heat. When hot, cover the bottom with nonstick spray.

Let the potstickers steam for about 4 minutes. If you really need to satisfy your curiosity and take a peek, just be sure to add more water. The end result should be that the pot stickers have a crispy golden brown bottom and a soft pasta top. We serve them at the Diner on a bed of garlic-sauteed spinach with a soy dipping sauce.
